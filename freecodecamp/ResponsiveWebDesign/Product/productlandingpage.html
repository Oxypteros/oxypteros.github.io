<h3>Elder	Sambucus</h3>	
<p>The Thestral's tail was crafted by the rarest wand wood of all, the Elder Sambucus. Is reputed to be deeply unlucky. The elder wand is trickier to master than any other. It contains powerful magic, but scorns to remain with any owner who is not the superior of his or her company; it takes a remarkable wizard to keep the elder wand for any length of time.</p></section>
