      <description>Alpha use three set of fonts.
Display fonts: Used for headings and buttons. Content fonts: The main font for the content. Monospace fonts: Font for code embeds. Alpha by default use this fonts:
Comfortaa as display font, Inter as content font, and JetBrain mono as monospace font. These three font families are loaded locally for performance reasons.
Change the default fonts If you wish to change the default fonts you can do it easily without change the code of the theme.</description>

      <description>Been around the World Wide Web twice, emailed everyone once.
Seen Windows 3.1 crash to DOS, been mIRC kid-scripter a mls writer.
I even used the real f-ing Napster.
I story/content/code write anywhere and everywhere. I do it more often than any other word or snippet pusher around.
I&amp;rsquo;m a soft-bodied, hairy-chested, rootin&amp;rsquo;-tootin&amp;rsquo; typewriting, mouse clicking, Tab spacing, thinking writer.
There ain&amp;rsquo;t anything I can&amp;rsquo;t do.
No code too complex, no script too buggy, no language too tough.</description>
