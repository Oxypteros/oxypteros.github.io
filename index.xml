      <description>Been around the World Wide Web twice, emailed everyone once.
Seen Windows 3.1 crash to DOS, been mIRC kid-scripter a mls writer.
I even used the real f-ing Napster.
I story/content/code write anywhere and everywhere. I do it more often than any other word or snippet pusher around.
I&amp;rsquo;m a soft-bodied, hairy-chested, rootin&amp;rsquo;-tootin&amp;rsquo; typewriting, mouse clicking, Tab spacing, thinking writer.
There ain&amp;rsquo;t anything I can&amp;rsquo;t do.
No code too complex, no script too buggy, no language too tough.</description>
